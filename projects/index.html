          <p>Many of my electronics projects are related to portablizing, which is a hobby of turning video game consoles into battery-powered handhelds. </p>
<h2 id="UltraWii"><a href="#UltraWii" class="headerlink" title="UltraWii"></a>UltraWii</h2><p>UltraWii is a portable Nintendo Wii I spent a few years iterating on throughout college. It uses a real Wii motherboard that has been trimmed down with a Dremel, and various ICs relocated to maintain functionality. Copious documentation by members of the BitBuilt.net community has enabled these sorts of hardmods. I designed numerous PCBs that perform a variety of functions in the unit, including a main four-layer board that incorporates USB C PD negotiation, 5A battery charging, voltage regulation for the Wii’s various voltage lines, an I2S audio amp, and thermal protection for the Wii. </p>
<img src="ultrawii.jpg" width="450">

<img src="reduced.jpg" width="450">

<p>I designed the first iteration of this board in early 2018, and continually update it to use newer and more interesting ICs. For me, PCB design is as much an art as it is engineering, so I enjoy iterating on the design for the sake of getting better. The current board is the sixth or seventh version.</p>
<img src="ultrawii_pcb.png" width="450">

<h2 id="Game-Console-Reimplementation"><a href="#Game-Console-Reimplementation" class="headerlink" title="Game Console Reimplementation"></a>Game Console Reimplementation</h2><p>These projects are all WIP attempts to reverse-engineer and reimplement video game console hardware into smaller and more efficient form factors. This usually involves capturing a schematic of the console, which requires stripping the motherboards and sanding the soldermask off, revealing the bare copper and internal layers. I scan these layers and use the images to RE the boards, cross-referencing existing partial schematics when they’re available. The original ICs must be removed and transplanted onto the new PCBs for these projects.</p>
<h3 id="αSNES-Super-Nintendo"><a href="#αSNES-Super-Nintendo" class="headerlink" title="αSNES (Super Nintendo)"></a>αSNES (Super Nintendo)</h3><img src="asnes.png" width="450">

<p>αSNES is a complete Super Nintendo on a 77x68mm four-layer PCB, including a BQ25792 for battery charging, a TPS61235 5V boost converter, and an LM49450 I2S audio amp. The battery charging and audio amp are controlled by an onboard ATtiny84A. This board has been tested and boots SNES games via a cartridge slot connected over FFC. </p>
<p>&lt;img src=”asnes.jpg” width=”450&gt;</p>
<img src="asnes_game.jpg" width="450">

<p>The redesign was aided by scans I made of the SNES Jr. motherboard in early 2020.</p>

<h3 id="Vegas-Nintendo-Wii"><a href="#Vegas-Nintendo-Wii" class="headerlink" title="Vegas (Nintendo Wii)"></a>Vegas (Nintendo Wii)</h3><img src="vegas_latest.png" width="450">

<p>This project was inspired by something my friend Aurelio started a few years ago, but didn’t finish. It’s in its early stages but will implement a full Nintendo Wii with all the accoutrement of a typical Wii portable integrated onto a single PCB. This design is more complex than the Dreamcast redesign since it uses GDDR3 and the onboard buses are very fast. Impedance calculations and careful consideration to board stackup have been taken into account to replicate the original motherboard’s characteristics. Right now I’m battling solderability issues after reballing the original Wii chipset and transplanting it onto the new PCB.</p>
<img src="vegas_front.jpg" width="450">

<img src="vegas_back.jpg" width="450">

<p>This project was made possible in part by scans I made of the Wii motherboard (in addition to existing scans from the BitBuilt community.)</p>

<h3 id="Muramasa-Sega-Dreamcast"><a href="#Muramasa-Sega-Dreamcast" class="headerlink" title="Muramasa (Sega Dreamcast)"></a>Muramasa (Sega Dreamcast)</h3><img src="mm.png" width="450">

<p>Muramasa is a WIP Sega Dreamcast motherboard redesign. The Dreamcast is infamous for having a large and complex motherboard, so a redesign of the system would help to shrink and streamline it for making portable handhelds. Referencing testing others in the community did a few years ago, I have replaced the original TSOP SDRAM and BIOS ICs with BGA packages and begun routing on the CPU and GPU which themselves are large and intimidating BGAs. Luckily the buses are slow enough that length- and impedance-matching aren’t necessary.</p>
<img src="katana.jpg" width="450">

<p>This project was also aided by scans I made in 2019 of the Dreamcast motherboard’s internal voltage planes; as far as I know, this was the first time the Dreamcast’s inner layers were imaged.</p>
<h2 id="MaplePad"><a href="#MaplePad" class="headerlink" title="MaplePad"></a>MaplePad</h2><img src="maplepad_logo.png" width="450">

<p>MaplePad is my heavily modified fork of Charlie Cole’s Dreamcast Pop’n Music Controller project, which implements the Sega Dreamcast’s Maple Bus (used for controllers and peripherals) in software and PIO on a Raspberry Pi RP2040. MaplePad is intended to be a feature-complete Dreamcast controller, VMU, and Purupuru (rumble) pack emulator for portablizing applications. I have designed, assembled and tested a number of custom RP2040 boards that run MaplePad code and function as DC controller replacements.</p>
<p>&lt;img src=”maplepad_collage.png width=”450”&gt;</p>

<h2 id="Flexible-PCBs"><a href="#Flexible-PCBs" class="headerlink" title="Flexible PCBs"></a>Flexible PCBs</h2><p>Sometimes relocating ICs on trimmed motherboards is easier with a flexible polyimide PCB. I have designed a number of these for various purposes.</p>
<h3 id="AVEflex"><a href="#AVEflex" class="headerlink" title="AVEflex"></a>AVEflex</h3><img src="flex.jpg" width="450">

<p>AVEflex is a flexible PCB for relocating the Audio-Video Encoder (AVE) on the Nintendo Wii. By placing the AVE under the CPU on the underside of the mainboard, the board can be trimmed smaller while retaining analog video and audio out.</p>
<img src="aveflex_install.jpg" width="450">

<h3 id="Dreamcast-FPCs"><a href="#Dreamcast-FPCs" class="headerlink" title="Dreamcast FPCs"></a>Dreamcast FPCs</h3><img src="gdemuflex.jpg" width="450">

<p>To enable further trimming of the Sega Dreamcast motherboard, I designed a trio of FPCs to relocate the AICA (sound coprocessor IC) and its SDRAM (replaced with modern BGA package), the BIOS (replaced with BGA) and disc drive connector, and the video encoder IC, named AICAflex, GDEMUflex, and DVEflex respectively.</p>
<p>I have spent about 9 months iterating on AICAflex; BGA SDRAM on an FPC is no joke. However as of July 2022 both GDEMUflex and AICAflex are working.</p>

<h2 id="Miscellaneous"><a href="#Miscellaneous" class="headerlink" title="Miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h2><p>These are some other things I’ve made over the years.</p>
<h3 id="Raspberry-Pi-Handhelds"><a href="#Raspberry-Pi-Handhelds" class="headerlink" title="Raspberry Pi Handhelds"></a>Raspberry Pi Handhelds</h3><p>I’ve created a number of Raspberry Pi handhelds, like this one with a RasPi 3 and a 3.5” screen driven with the Pi’s parallel interface.</p>
<img src="pi3p.png" width="450">

<h3 id="Capstone-Project"><a href="#Capstone-Project" class="headerlink" title="Capstone Project"></a>Capstone Project</h3><p>My engineering capstone project was a datalogger with ruggedization requirements. My design had a redundant fallback datalogging system with a captive SD slot to ensure we would still collect data in the case of the main system’s failure.</p>
<img src="capstone.jpg" width="450">

<h3 id="Art-PCBs"><a href="#Art-PCBs" class="headerlink" title="Art PCBs"></a>Art PCBs</h3><p>I enjoy dabbling in PCB artwork. The small color palette and limitations of the Gerber format make it a fun medium.</p>
